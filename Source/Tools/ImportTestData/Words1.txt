President Barack Obama will announce his nominee for the Supreme Court at 11 am Eastern time on Wednesday, the White House said in an early morning email.

The name of the nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia is not yet known, though Reuters reported that it would be either Judge Sri Srinivasan or Judge Merrick Garland. 

The announcement, which Obama will make in the Rose Garden, will kick off a major Capitol Hill fight for the president. Republicans have said they not only will oppose any nominee, but also refuse to hold hearings or even meet with him or her. 

"In putting forward a nominee today, I am fulfilling my constitutional duty," Obama said. "I’m doing my job. I hope that our senators will do their jobs, and move quickly to consider my nominee. That is what the Constitution dictates, and that’s what the American people expect and deserve from their leaders."

Still, the president has vowed to fulfill what he sees as his constitutional obligation to fill the vacant court seat. That battle begins Wednesday, as he noted in an email to supporters.
